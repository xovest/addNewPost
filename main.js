const postsList = document.querySelector('.posts-list');

/*
const url = 'http://localhost:5500/api/posts';
 That url doesn't work, need to see what's up with that cors error and how I can configure that package already so that it works, but dunno about the mongo still, don't wanna bother now since i'm noob

fetch(url)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
